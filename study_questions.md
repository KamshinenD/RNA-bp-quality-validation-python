 Meaningful Questions We Could Answer

  1. Do torsion differences predict poor quality?
    - Compare delta_diff, chi_diff etc. between good vs poor base-pairs
    - Find thresholds that flag problems
  2. Does sugar pucker matter?
    - Does pucker mismatch (C2'-endo vs C3'-endo) correlate with poor quality?
    - Which pucker combinations are riskiest?
  3. Chi conformation effects
    - Does syn vs anti mismatch hurt quality?
    - Are syn conformations inherently associated with problems?
  4. EM vs X-ray differences
    - Do EM structures have different backbone patterns?
    - Does the same torsion deviation matter differently by method?
  5. Specific torsion outliers
    - Which angles, when non-canonical, predict poor quality?
